A platform for social projects looking for volunteers.

„Solve for Good is a platform for social good organizations to describe and submit problems that need data intensive help, and for volunteers to help solve those problems.“

While looking for the "Data Science For Social Good Summer Followship", which is unfortunately cancelled this year, I came across this [platform for social good projects] by chance, which offers the possibility to join as a volunteer to support such projects. Really recommend to have a look there and join as a volunteer or start your own project.

Happy researching!
